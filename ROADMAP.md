# Roadmap

Actionable work only. Historical and completed roadmap material is archived in CHANGELOG.md; blocked work is kept in Roadmap_Blocked.md.

## Research-Driven Additions

ID scheme: `AD-nn`, continue sequentially from the highest below.

### P0

### P1

### P2

- [ ] P2 — AD-40 — Detect archived items the source has since deleted
  Why: an archive whose upstream entry disappears silently rots. Tartube's "Missing Videos" folder is the only implementation in the field, and pinchflat#805 (11 reactions) asks for the inverse guarantee — do not re-download what the user deleted locally. Both need the same reconciliation between the archive and the last scan.
  Evidence: Tartube README §6.25; pinchflat#805; `astra_downloader/subscriptions.py` archive keys.
  Touches: `astra_downloader/subscriptions.py`, `gui_subscriptions_page.py`, `gui_history_page.py`
  Acceptance: a scan that no longer sees a previously-archived item marks it, without deleting anything; a locally-deleted file is not silently re-fetched; both states are visible and reversible. Depends on AD-25.
  Complexity: M

### P3

- [ ] P3 — AD-46 — Also persist the queue outside the manager lock
  Why: `_persist_locked` runs `atomic_write_json` → `os.fsync` under `DownloadManagerCore._lock` from ~15 call sites, and the Qt main thread takes that same lock every 500 ms via `update_timer` → `_update_ui`. On a slow or BitLocker-throttled disk this is a visible stall that nothing measures. Same shape as AD-11, lower frequency.
  Evidence: `astra_downloader/download.py:3706-3715`, called from `:3696, :3902, :4402, :5649`; `gui.py:1166-1168`, `:4148`.
  Touches: `astra_downloader/download.py`
  Acceptance: the serialize+fsync happens outside the lock (snapshot under the lock, write after); a test asserts the lock is not held across the write.
  Complexity: M
