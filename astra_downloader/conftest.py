"""Test-run isolation for the companion suite.

The suite exercises the REAL DownloadManager / updater wiring, whose logger
is ``astra_downloader.write_persistent_log``. Without redirection every run
appended fabricated failure lines ("updater exploded", "disk full",
"SHA-256 mismatch") to the production ``%LOCALAPPDATA%/AstraDownloader/
server.log`` — growing it and poisoning any later support/debug read.
``write_persistent_log`` binds ``LOG_PATH`` late specifically so this
fixture can point the module globals at a per-run temp file.

``INSTALL_DIR`` is redirected for the same reason and it is not optional:
``DownloadManagerCore`` roots the site-login store there, so a test that
builds a real manager and imports a fixture cookie wrote
``site-logins/x.com.txt`` into the user's live install — a fabricated sign-in
that would then be listed in the GUI and attached to real downloads for that
site. The dependency reads the module global on each call, so redirecting it
here covers every manager the suite constructs.

The JavaScript runtime paths are redirected too, and they need their own
line because redirecting ``INSTALL_DIR`` does not reach them: ``DENO_PATH``
and ``QUICKJS_PATH`` are derived from it at import, so they keep pointing at
the live install. That made runtime tests depend on whether the developer's
own machine happened to have a runtime provisioned — a test asserting "no
runtime is available" passed only because this box had none.
