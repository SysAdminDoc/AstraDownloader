# Changelog

All notable changes to Astra Downloader are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Releases before 2.0.0 were made from the
[Astra Deck](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Astra-Deck) repository, where this
program lived as a companion service. That history is preserved in this
repository's git log.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-05

Astra Downloader is its own product, in its own repository, designed around
the thing it is actually for: downloading a video.

### Changed

- **The window opens on Download.** The paste box is the first thing on the
  first page, sized like the product's front door rather than a field on a
  secondary tab. The queue sits directly beneath it.
- **The server moved to a Browser extension page.** The local API that serves
  the Astra Deck extension is a feature of the downloader, not its dashboard.
  The page says so plainly: downloading by pasting a link never needs it.
- **Tool readiness moved to the Download page.** yt-dlp, FFmpeg, the
  JavaScript runtime and SABR support are what determine whether a download
  works, so they are visible where downloads happen. The Local API row stayed
  with the server.
- **The navigation rail is ordered by use**: Download, History, Sign-ins,
  Subscriptions, Browser extension, Settings.
- **The rail's status line names what it reports.** An unlabelled "Stopped" in
  a downloader reads as a broken app; it now says "Extension server".
- **An empty queue points at the paste box**, not at a server dashboard.
- **Self-update targets this repository.** `APP_VERSION`, the release API, the
  executable and its SHA-256 sidecar all resolve against
  `SysAdminDoc/AstraDownloader` instead of the extension's releases.

### Added

- Version, catch-reason, port-catalogue and Python dependency gates run from
  this repository (`npm run check`), with a `check-versions` gate that also
  pins the name of the `APP_VERSION` test so a bump cannot silently pass while
  naming the previous release.
- Four tests pin the downloader-first layout as a design decision rather than
  an accident of edit order: Download is first and is the landing page, the
  server page is named for the extension it serves, download-tool readiness
  lives with the paste box, and the empty queue points at the paste box.

### Removed

- The extension-side half of the port-catalogue check and generator. Astra
  Deck checks its own consumers against its own copy of the catalogue JSON;
  the two copies are the contract.
- The locale test's dependency on the extension's `_locales` directory. The
  companion now pins its own shipped catalogues: every advertised locale ships
  a compiled `.qm` with a `.ts` source, and nothing ships a catalogue the app
  cannot select.
